  <p>Accurate, easy to use and to interpret, and readily accessible emailable results. Highly endorsed both by me, and by my cardiologist. Very reasonably priced for the service.</p>

  <h2>Worth the Price and Peace of Mind</h2>

  <p>Have been using KardiaBand since December and had an AFib incident recently which the watch detected, recorded, and alerted me. Combined with the SmartRhythm feature for the Apple Watch takes it one step further and alerts you if it sees an irregular pattern and you can take the ekg trace on the spot. My cardiologist loves the reports it produces. What makes the band easy is if it occurs at night you get the alert and don't have to find your phone.</p>
